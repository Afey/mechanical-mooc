Item #2:  Connect with your Team.

Each Friday we'll remind you to use your Team as a layer of support as you move through the Mechanical MOOC. A few ideas to get your group going:
 - Where are you at in the course material? Share your progress.</li>
 - Ask a question that you've been puzzling over.</li>
 - Share a success you've recently had in your learning experience.</li>
 - On a scale of 1-10, how are you feeling this week.</li>

Carry forth, MOOCsters,
