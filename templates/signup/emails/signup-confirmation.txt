Welcome to "Play With Your Music"--we'll get underway in earnest around November 1st. That's when you'll receive an email from the course Maestro, "Mister Mix" with some stellar activities to get you making music.

With that first email, you'll be placed in your musical cohort--30 to 40 folks that you'll be sharing your tunes with. Don't be shy--you can go ahead and introduce yourself by hitting "reply." 

In the meantime, you might want to register for an account with Soundation (http://soundation.com/) and SoundCloud (https://soundcloud.com/). If you have any #PWYM-related questions, you can post them to our Google+ community: http://bit.ly/1aiSsfw

Now you're vaguely rockin'...
