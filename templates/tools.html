        <p>In the first phase of the course, you'll become familiar with the basic "critical listening" skills of music--identifying instruments, voices and song structures. And you'll do it by playing with your own interactive band.</p>

        <p>Next you'll get your hands dirty by working with a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) and learn the basics of audio track editing and shifting. Using Soundation you'll mix your own audio track to match a studio recording.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a>.</h2>
        <p>Soon, you'll be remixing your favorite songs and coming up with your own glorious creations. You'll post the files to SoundCloud's listening community, share them with your cohort, and give each other feedback.</p>
